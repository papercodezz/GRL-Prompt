The prompt template is designed to interact with different LLMs using the proposed GRL-Prompt. The figure demonstrates the designated prompt template format. Notably, the sequence of the in-context examples ``` \vec{\emph{P}}_{ic} = [p_{ic}^{1}, ..., p_{ic}^{K}] ``` in the prompt template is generated by GRL-Prompt, and the user query $q$ is derived from the test data. In the figure, the placeholders (marked as red) denote the in-context examples and the user query.
